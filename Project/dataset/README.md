# Red Wine Quality Dataset

Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

**About the Dataset** :

The dataset contains a total of 12 variables, which were recorded for 1,599 observations.

The input variables (based on physicochemical tests) : 

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

The output variable (based on sensory data) :

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

**NOTE :** Since the dataset consists of only single csv file, I have manually partitioned it in two files, red_wine_train.csv and red_wine_val.csv for training and validation purposes. I have renamed some coulmns of winequality.csv, so as to save time in data processing in each section of the project.
